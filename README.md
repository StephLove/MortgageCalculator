This is an app created to show mortgage payments. It breaks down the total payment, total amount toward interest and total amount toward principle. 
It will break down month by month and displays a graph showing how the total paid into interest decreases as the life of the loan increases. 
At the end it shows the total cost of the loan based on initial loan amount, length of loan, and interest.
